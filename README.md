SG - a library for creating slopegraphs

==

sg.js creates SVG content, is dependency-free and should work in modern browsers with SVG support. 

To use, call SG(jsonData, svgElement, settings). Settings are optional but you most likely will want to set at least textWidth, slopeWidth & height. See sg.html for some examples

Data is expected as a json array with 'id', 'set' & 'val' attributes.
